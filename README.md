# FPGA with 100 Project

Hello!

My name is Afshin, and I am an FPGA enthusiast. I created this repository to teach how to use Vivado and RTL coding within 100 projects. These projects will be added over time, and below you can find the description of each project.

**Day 000 - Environment Setup**
This project explains how to set up your environment and introduces the workflow that will be followed in the tutorial series.

**Day 001 - MUX Setup and Study of Different Implementations**
In this project, we explore the concept of a multiplexer (MUX) and study different ways of implementing it to optimize resource usage.

Please note that the repository is a work in progress, and new projects will be added regularly.

Feel free to explore the projects and follow along with the tutorials!
